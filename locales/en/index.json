When it comes to where to learn surfing in Europe, many people think of Portugal and believe that the best waves in the world are there. Not quite so, Portugal is known for the biggest wave on the planet. That's true, but this wave forms only in one spot and only during certain months. The Canary Islands, on the other hand, are the European Hawaii! Here, the surfing season lasts all year round! The water is always warm, and if we talk about the south of Tenerife, there are about 360 sunny days a year. Both in winter and summer, the air temperature is around +25! The abundance of surfing spots allows you to choose the most convenient place for learning. The island has plenty of places with large Atlantic waves, but at the same time, there are always spots with comfortable waves for learning, suitable for your skill level.","aboutRightCard":"What are we doing?","aboutRightText":"FunVibe is an incredible mix of extreme, sun, and ocean!
